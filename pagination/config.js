  description: `<p>Lucy is more than a pet; she’s my best friend, my shadow, my family. She’s been with me through heartbreaks, illness, and loss.</p><p>Now, she’s the one fighting to survive… and I feel completely helpless.</p><p>Lucy was diagnosed with a fast-growing cancerous tumor behind her eye. The swelling happened almost overnight. Within days, she was in constant pain and unable to eat.</p><p>The vet told me she needs emergency surgery or the tumor will spread to her brain.</p><p>She’s only six years old. She used to jump into my bed every morning. Now she just lies there, trembling… confused… suffering.</p><p>I’m terrified I’m going to lose her not because she can’t be saved, but because I can’t afford to save her.</p><p>Please help me protect Lucy. Help me fight for her the way she’s always loved me without question.</p><h2>What the donations will help cover:</h2><ul><li>Lucy’s emergency cancer surgery</li><li>Follow-up treatment, medication, and scans</li><li>Pain relief and recovery care</li></ul><p>Let’s give her a chance to live the life she deserves. 🐾💔</p>`,
